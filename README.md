# Non-OoO Random Equation Generator
This is a web app that generates math equations consisting of a random number of
randomly-generated integers and basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division). The generator was written with Javascript and JQuery, and designed with
HTML and Bootstrap.

## Caveat: Not Order of Operations
The equations generated here are evaluated from left-to-right, and thus do not honor
the standard order of operations ("please excuse my dear aunt sally").

## Codepen
